# ML Template - Training directory

Add information and instructions here around the training code and tests.

e.g. run `poetry install` and `poetry shell` to get started.

## Notebooks
Any work done in Jupyter Notebooks is relevant and should be shared in the [notebooks directory](notebooks/README.md).

## Testing
We try to test everything! However, testing everything within a TFX pipeline or ML models in general is quite hard, but you can read more about our approach [here](src/test/README.md).
