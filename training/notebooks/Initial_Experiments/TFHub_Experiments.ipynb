    "# POC Reimplementation of Model Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The original implementation of the NBCU tagger used a BERT tokenizer from HuggingFace. The main limitation of this approach is that tokenization had to be performed **before** the tfx pipeline, so the tokenizer wasn't actually incorporated into the model. The result of this is that tokenization steps would have to be performed manually on the serving side as well by loading in the same tokenizer. This reimplmentation of the same logic would make maintenance more difficult and could potentially cause training-serving skew. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are a lot of BERT models (with their accompanying tokenizers) on [TFHUB](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub). This notebook is basically just following [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/classify_text_with_bert#about_bert), but for the NBCU data. The goal is just to get a feel for how to use TFHub and get an idea of whether using TFHub instead of hugging face would actually work. \n",

    "Let's test TFHub! "

However, Moushmi records a video of him with the girls and gets excited to show it to Baa. An infuriated Natasha manhandles Tiara, the actress who has taken the former's role in a film. Later, she learns that a video of the scuffle has gone viral on the Internet. Baa spots one of her workers watching Natasha's seductive video while preparing food and fires him. Later, Naksh shows Baa a picture of Paakhi with Natasha, leaving her furious. Jaanki and Paakhi are left utterly shocked after learning about the money they owe Baa. Later, Baa refuses to give Naksh an off, leaving him disappointed and furious at Paakhi. When a group of women protestors try to blacken Natasha's face, Paakhi steps in to protect her. Later, Baa gathers all her workers and declares that from that moment on, Naksh will supervise over their catering business. Paakhi somehow gets out of the mess she created at the car showroom, leaving behind an infuriated Naksh. Meanwhile, Kapadia brings over a few papers for Natasha to sign but its contents leave her astonished. Pinky fools Jaanki and takes her to his house, after which Natasha begins to blackmail Paakhi to do her bidding. Later, when Paakhi hands the account papers to Moushmi, the latter decides to use it to cause trouble. Akash learns that Paakhi is the girl who had dubbed for Natasha. Later, Naksh meets up with Paakhi and expresses his gratitude to her for sending his pictures to the newspaper company. Due to Baa's solid moral compass, Jaanki and Paakhi are allowed to stay in the house for the night. However, she orders them to leave first thing the next morning. Natasha realizes that it is difficult to sign Paakhi as her dubbing artist. She, therefore, resorts to dishonest means and, disguising herself as Baa, puts poison in the sweets meant for the kids at the orphanage. Naksh comes over to the police station and requests the inspector to let Jaanki go. Meanwhile, Natasha reveals to Akash that it was she who framed Jaanki for robbery. To make up for her hoarse voice, aspiring actress Natasha looks for a dubbing artist. After a desperate search, her team finds Paakhi, a girl with an alluring voice, which would perfectly complement Natasha's seductive personality. When Paakhi returns home from her auditions, she gets annoyed to see her mother doing all the work in the house. She later approaches her aunt and uncle, and asks them to help her mother with the household chores. Natasha mocks Paakhi when the latter goes down on her knees and begs her to delete Baa's video. Paakhi later signs a contract, according to which she will have to change her name to Silk. Just as Paakhi and her mother are about to step out of the house, Baa stops them and apologizes for asking them to leave. This only infuriates Naksh even more, making him determined to exact revenge on her. Paakhi tries to find the culprit who stole the valuables from Baa's room. Meanwhile, a furious Natasha threatens to file a case against Kapadia. With nowhere to spend the night, Paakhi and her mother wander the streets with their luggage. The next day, Paakhi learns about a job with a salary of INR 50,000. Paakhi finds herself in a dilemma after the recent developments and reminisces about her father. Later, Baa reminds her of her responsibility to convince Naksh to take over the catering business. When the reputation of Baa's catering business is threatened because of Naksh, she furiously scolds him. Enraged, Naksh accuses Paakhi of showing Baa the video on purpose to turn her against him. Naksh is infuriated when Paakhi and her mother move into his house to live as paying guests. Meanwhile, Paakhi's mother gets emotional thinking about her late husband and the house he built for her. When Baa asks Paakhi and Jaanki to leave her house, a reluctant Paakhi vows to prove that she is innocent. Meanwhile, Nayan tries to attack Naksh. Bhaiji and his disciples partake of the meal Paakhi prepared and express their content, leaving Baa relieved. Later, Baa scolds Paakhi for intervening in her business matters. With Paakhi out of the house, Naksh realizes that he has judged her wrongly and feels strange without her around. Meanwhile, Paakhi and her mother finds themselves in trouble. Paakhi finds out from Nayan that he was creating trouble for her under Natasha's orders. Later, Paakhi stops Nayan's infuriated wife from attacking Natasha. Paakhi lies to her mother and tells her that the greeting card was sent to her by Naksh. Later, Naksh tells Paakhi about a photography competition that he wants to take part in but needs a huge sum of money to register for. Paakhi manages to prevent Baa from finding out about her picture in the newspaper. Meanwhile, Moushmi steals Baa's valuable items. Kapadia refuses to cast Natasha without the dubbing artist with the alluring voice. Meanwhile, Paakhi meets up with Baa, a strict landowner in whose house she wishes to rent a room. However, to her dismay, Naksh happens to be Baa's grandson. The praises Paakhi receives after the shoot, makes her uncomfortable. Later, Baa is left shocked after she enters Naksh's room and sees his collection of photographs. The police come over in the morning to Naksh's house to arrest Jaanki. Later, Natasha forces Paakhi to watch the former's seductive video and asks her to dub for it. To keep her job, Paakhi goes so far as to steal a car from a showroom to drive Natasha to the studio on time. Meanwhile, Naksh finds himself in deep trouble but is unaware that Paakhi is responsible for his plight. After learning the truth about his father, Naksh gets ready to leave the house to follow his dreams. Later, his mother loses her temper and slaps him for disrespecting Baa. Moushmi pretends to have sprained her ankle to distract the family members while her husband implements a vicious plan in the kitchen. Later, Baa reprimands Paakhi for leaving the stove on and causing a gas leak. With her mother's help, Paakhi realizes that Natasha was the one who had disguised herself as Baa and poisoned the sweets. Later, Natasha blackmails Paakhi into dubbing for her by threatening to release a morphed video of Baa. Paakhi finds out from Naksh that she has made it into the photography competition. Later, in an attempt to teach Natasha a lesson she'll never forget, Paakhi conspires against her. Paakhi tries her best to hide from Baa the fact that Ishaan, disguised as Naksh, is working with the former. Later, she finds herself in deep trouble when an unknown man comes below the mansion and yells out her name. Paakhi finds out that Baa did not come to the orphanage and gets suspicious. Later, she gets a call from Akash, who tells her that the sweets have been poisoned. Akash confronts Paakhi and asks her why she kept her identity hidden from him and Natasha. He later threatens to fire her if she does not agree to dub for Natasha. Akash presents the contract to Paakhi. Enraged, she burns the contract and orders Natasha and Akash to stop meddling in her affairs. After watching the video of Naksh speaking to two sex workers, Baa throws his luggage at him and asks him to leave the house immediately. However, Paakhi steps in and covers for him. Natasha finds herself in a fix when she drives her car straight into another man's car. Paakhi decides to use this opportunity to get into Natasha's good books and helps her. Paakhi reluctantly throws a bucket of cold water over Naksh on Baa's instructions, leaving him furious. Later, when Paakhi answers Natasha's video call, she sees the latter trying to hang herself. After Natasha's video, which has Paakhi's voice in it, goes viral, a few reporters stall her at a temple and ask her to speak so that their viewers can hear her voice again. Paakhi, however, helps get her out of the situation. According to Paakhi's plan, Rati pretends to be the girl who had previously dubbed for Natasha. Meanwhile, Naksh finds out that all the pictures he had of Paakhi and Natasha have been deleted from his camera. While hiding in Naksh's room, Paakhi overhears him pouring his heart out to his mother. Later, when Paakhi returns home late at night, Baa gives her a warning and asks her to leave the house if she cannot follow the rules of the house.\"\n",
