# Example notebooks README

Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, analysis, and presentation of results.

Feel free to add any information about the notebooks here.

The notebooks in this repo are taken from the [Semantic Tagging TFX](https://github.com/sky-uk/disco-semantic-tagging-tfx) repo, which can be used as examples, but delete them from your repo and add your own.
